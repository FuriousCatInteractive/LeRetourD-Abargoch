Thank you for downloading Advanced Fantasy AI Free Edition!


Quick Setup:


-To see action in seconds, go to the 'AI Character Setup Folder' and drag and drop the 'AI Skelly 
Prefab'


-To make the AI attack or follow a target/player, assign the object/player you want him to interact with to 

his 'Target' in the inspector.  IMPORTANT!  In order for your AI to 'see' his target, the collision 

layer of the object assigned must be the 'Character Collision Layer'.  By default the Chracter Collision 

Layer is 15.




Quick Custom Character Setup:

-To setup your own custom character, drag and drop the AI Empty Prefab into your scene.

-Then you must place your character inside capsule of the Empty AI Prefab(It must be scaled correctly, make sure the feet touch the bottom and the head touches the top).

-Now, drag and drop your character model into the empty prefab in the Hierarchy, making the AI prefab the 'parent' of the character model.

-Now you must assign your character model to the 'AI Character' in the inspector of the AI prefab.

-If your character has animations, you may assign, run, idle, attack, and death animations.
